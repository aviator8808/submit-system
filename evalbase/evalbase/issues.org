* Issues

** DONE Make an issue list.
** DONE Editing the user profile.
** DONE Sign up a new organization for a conference.
** DONE Join an organization.
** DONE Edit organization details.
** DONE Update home view to include open conferences and my memberships
** DONE Confirm that new-account-creation works.
** DONE Render a form based on database entries for a task.
** DONE Submit a form (like the ad-form)
    - Right now, forms are modeled with tasks.  This lets me require a form
      from a group, but not from an individual.  Individual agreements
      should happen when creating or joining an organization in a conf.

** DONE Submit a file
** DONE Submit a file and complete a meta form
** DONE Make a task
** DONE View my submissions
** DONE review submission meta-data details
** TODO update/revise, or delete (?) a submission
** DONE edit metadata for submission
CLOSED: [2022-12-14 Wed 13:19]
** TODO submission validation
** TODO View submission validation status
** TODO Sign an agreement
- Idea: have open forms listed on the conf tasks page
** TODO View agreements signed and unsigned
** TODO make an activity log more application-specific than "recent changes"

** ONGOING the submitted runs display should really be elsewhere.  It also shows "Already submitted" even if there are no submissions.  And it should only show for this user, or this org, or this conference.

** RESOLVED on the submission form the choice of organization should be limited to those in the current conference.

CLOSED: [2021-11-23 Tue 15:09]
